## 📝 **1. Retention Policy – Email Auto-Archive (1 Year)**

The retention policy automatically moves emails older than **365 days** into the **Archive Mailbox**, providing:

- Reduced primary mailbox size  
- Improved Outlook performance  
- Long-term mailbox compliance  
- Better data governance  
- Reduced risk of accidental deletion  

This is ideal for organisations with storage concerns or heavy email usage.
